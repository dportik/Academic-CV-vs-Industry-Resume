## Academic-CV-vs-Industry-Resume
 
In this repository you can find an example of my academic CV and my industry resume. The goal is to provide a 1:1 of these documents - they both describe me and my past experiences, but you can see how drastically different they are. 

It was initially difficult to create an industry resume based on my academic experience, but here are some of the guidelines that I used (gathered from a variety of sources):

- Focus on listing key skills. Technical skills are important, but soft skills are just as important to include (communication, team interaction, leadership, etc.).
- For positions and experiences, focus on the tangible products developed. This can be new experimental techniques, methodological advances, coding projects, grant awards, etc. 
- Make sure to include keywords related to the job. For example, if the job ad indicates Python or AWS are important (and you have this experience!) make sure these appear in the resume. NEVER list a skill you don't have experience with. 
- If demonstrating coding experience is required for the job, being able to show examples is important. If you have a github with examples of completed projects, include this link so the hiring manager can see your portfolio.
- Keep length between 1-2 pages. 
- Listing a subset of publications can be useful, but make sure they are relevant to the position.  
- Remove any information that is not relevant to the position. For many of us, this will probably mean removing 95% of what's in the academic CV! Oof!

Finally, it can be really helpful to ask for feedback from individuals with industry positions. It may take a couple of rounds of revisions to develop a strong industry resume, and having outside perspective is always beneficial.
